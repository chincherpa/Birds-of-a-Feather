# Birds of a Feather

I was inspired by [these designs](https://nytrami.design/graphic-design/classic-british-bird-illustrations/) and tried to make a generative version that would create unique, random birds.

If you want to run this project yourself, make sure to download [Processing](processing.org) and use the Python module.
